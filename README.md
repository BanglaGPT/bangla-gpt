# BanglaGPT
BanglaGPT is an ongoing project that aims to develop a state-of-the-art language model for the Bengali (Bangla) language. This repository contains the training code for the BanglaGPT model and is actively being developed.

## About BanglaGPT
BanglaGPT is a language model inspired by OpenAI's GPT architecture, specifically designed for the Bengali language. It aims to generate coherent and contextually relevant text in Bengali across various applications such as natural language understanding, machine translation, text completion, and more.

The model is being developed using modern deep learning techniques and architectures, with a focus on capturing the rich linguistic nuances and complexities of the Bengali language. It incorporates a large amount of Bengali text data for pre-training, enabling it to learn patterns and semantic representations specific to the language.

## Project Status
The architecture and development of the BanglaGPT model are currently in the early stages. The repository will provides the necessary code for training the model and is subject to frequent updates and improvements.
